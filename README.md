# Left-Ventricular-Function-using-Two-Dimensional-Echocardiography
The study involves a comparison of 2D and 3D ultrasound volume measurement techniques, cardiac function evaluation using clinical ultrasound, and the development of a MATLAB routine to evaluate cardiac function.
This report discusses the importance of cardiac imaging techniques in diagnosing and managing heart conditions. Among these techniques, echocardiography is the most commonly used non-invasive, portable and inexpensive method. However, there are some limitations in measuring left ventricular function using two-dimensional echocardiography. Three-dimensional ultrasound is being developed to overcome these limitations. The objective of this study is to gain exposure to the clinical use of ultrasound in cardiology and to experience the use of several modern ultrasound devices and techniques for evaluating cardiovascular function. The study involves a comparison of 2D and 3D ultrasound volume measurement techniques, cardiac function evaluation using clinical ultrasound, and the development of a MATLAB routine to evaluate cardiac function. The results obtained from these experiments are discussed.
